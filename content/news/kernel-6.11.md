   "Assorted little stuff:
  
     - lockdep fixup for lockdep_set_notrack_class()
  
     - we can now remove a device when using erasure coding without
       deadlocking, though we still hit other issues
  
     - the 'allocator stuck' timeout is now configurable, and messages are
       ratelimited. The default timeout has been increased from 10 seconds
       to 30"
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2024-08-08' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:
    bcachefs: Use bch2_wait_on_allocator() in btree node alloc path
    bcachefs: Make allocator stuck timeout configurable, ratelimit messages
    bcachefs: Add missing path_traverse() to btree_iter_next_node()
    bcachefs: ec should not allocate from ro devs

   "A couple last minute fixes for the new disk accounting
  
     - fix a bug that was causing ACLs to seemingly "disappear"
  
     - new on disk format version, bcachefs_metadata_version_disk_accounting_v3
  
       bcachefs_metadata_version_disk_accounting_v2 accidentally included
       padding in disk_accounting_key; fortunately, 6.11 isn't out yet so
       we can fix this with another version bump"

   - New on disk format version, bcachefs_metadata_version_disk_accounting_inum
  
     This adds one more disk accounting counter, which counts disk usage
     and number of extents per inode number. This lets us track
     fragmentation, for implementing defragmentation later, and it also
     counts disk usage per inode in all snapshots, which will be a useful
     thing to expose to users.
  
   - One performance issue we've observed is threads spinning when they
     should be waiting for dirty keys in the key cache to be flushed by
     journal reclaim, so we now have hysteresis for the waiting thread, as
     well as improving the tracepoint and a new time_stat, for tracking
     time blocked waiting on key cache flushing.
  
  ... and various assorted smaller fixes.

  Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
  
   - fix ca->io_ref usage; analagous to previous patch doing that for main
     discard path
  
   - cond_resched() in __journal_keys_sort(), cutting down on "hung task"
     warnings when journal is big
  
   - rest of basic BCH_SB_MEMBER_INVALID support
  
   - and the critical one: don't delete open files in online fsck, this
     was causing the "dirent points to inode that doesn't point back"
     inconsistencies some users were seeing
