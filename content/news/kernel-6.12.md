This post summarizes bcachefs merges that landed in Linux 6.12.

## RC1

- **2024-09-23**: Merge tag 'bcachefs-2024-09-21' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs ([commit](https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/b3f391fddf3cfaadda59ec8da8fd17f4520bbf42))

  Pull bcachefs updates from Kent Overstreet:
  
   - rcu_pending, btree key cache rework: this solves lock contenting in
     the key cache, eliminating the biggest source of the srcu lock hold
     time warnings, and drastically improving performance on some metadata
     heavy workloads - on multithreaded creates we're now 3-4x faster than
     xfs.
  
   - We're now using an rhashtable instead of the system inode hash table;
     this is another significant performance improvement on multithreaded
     metadata workloads, eliminating more lock contention.
  
   - for_each_btree_key_in_subvolume_upto(): new helper for iterating over
     keys within a specific subvolume, eliminating a lot of open coded
     "subvolume_get_snapshot()" and also fixing another source of srcu
     lock time warnings, by running each loop iteration in its own
     transaction (as the existing for_each_btree_key() does).
  
   - More work on btree_trans locking asserts; we now assert that we don't
     hold btree node locks when trans->locked is false, which is important
     because we don't use lockdep for tracking individual btree node
     locks.
  
   - Some cleanups and improvements in the bset.c btree node lookup code,
     from Alan.
  
   - Rework of btree node pinning, which we use in backpointers fsck. The
     old hacky implementation, where the shrinker just skipped over nodes
     in the pinned range, was causing OOMs; instead we now use another
     shrinker with a much higher seeks number for pinned nodes.
  
   - Rebalance now uses BCH_WRITE_ONLY_SPECIFIED_DEVS; this fixes an issue
     where rebalance would sometimes fall back to allocating from the full
     filesystem, which is not what we want when it's trying to move data
     to a specific target.
  
   - Use __GFP_ACCOUNT, GFP_RECLAIMABLE for btree node, key cache
     allocations.
  
   - Idmap mounts are now supported (Hongbo Li)
  
   - Rename whiteouts are now supported (Hongbo Li)
  
   - Erasure coding can now handle devices being marked as failed, or
     forcibly removed. We still need the evacuate path for erasure coding,
     but it's getting very close to ready for people to start using.

  Pull more bcachefs updates from Kent Overstreet:
   "Assorted minor syzbot fixes, and for bigger stuff:
  
    Fix two disk accounting rewrite bugs:
  
     - Disk accounting keys use the version field of bkey so that journal
       replay can tell which updates have been applied to the btree.
  
       This is set in the transaction commit path, after we've gotten our
       journal reservation (and our time ordering), but the
       BCH_TRANS_COMMIT_skip_accounting_apply flag that journal replay
       uses was incorrectly skipping this for new updates generated prior
       to journal replay.
  
       This fixes the underlying cause of an assertion pop in
       disk_accounting_read.
  
     - A couple of fixes for disk accounting + device removal.
  
       Checking if acocunting replicas entries were marked in the
       superblock was being done at the wrong point, when deltas in the
       journal could still zero them out, and then additionally we'd try
       to add a missing replicas entry to the superblock without checking
       if it referred to an invalid (removed) device.
  
    A whole slew of repair fixes:
  
     - fix infinite loop in propagate_key_to_snapshot_leaves(), this fixes
       an infinite loop when repairing a filesystem with many snapshots
  
     - fix incorrect transaction restart handling leading to occasional
       "fsck counted ..." warnings
  
     - fix warning in __bch2_fsck_err() for bkey fsck errors
  
     - check_inode() in fsck now correctly checks if the filesystem was
       clean
  
     - there shouldn't be pending logged ops if the fs was clean, we now
       check for this
  
     - remove_backpointer() doesn't remove a dirent that doesn't actually
       point to the inode
  
     - many more fsck errors are AUTOFIX"

     - bcachefs's __wait_on_freeing_inode() was broken in rc1 due to vfs

       data structure copygc uses); along with some nice simplification.

       (due to another filesystem error) we delete the logged op instead
       of going into an infinite loop)

  Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
   "Lots of hotfixes:
  
     - transaction restart injection has been shaking out a few things
  
     - fix a data corruption in the buffered write path on -ENOSPC, found
       by xfstests generic/299
  
     - Some small show_options fixes
  
     - Repair mismatches in inode hash type, seed: different snapshot
       versions of an inode must have the same hash/type seed, used for
       directory entries and xattrs. We were checking the hash seed, but
       not the type, and a user contributed a filesystem where the hash
       type on one inode had somehow been flipped; these fixes allow his
       filesystem to repair.
  
       Additionally, the hash type flip made some directory entries
       invisible, which were then recreated by userspace; so the hash
       check code now checks for duplicate non dangling dirents, and
       renames one of them if necessary.
  
     - Don't use wait_event_interruptible() in recovery: this fixes some
       filesystems failing to mount with -ERESTARTSYS
  
     - Workaround for kvmalloc not supporting > INT_MAX allocations,
       causing an -ENOMEM when allocating the sorted array of journal
       keys: this allows a 75 TB filesystem to mount
  
     - Make sure bch_inode_unpacked.bi_snapshot is set in the old inode
       compat path: this alllows Marcin's filesystem (in use since before
       6.7) to repair and mount"

  Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
   "Various syzbot fixes, and the more notable ones:
  
     - Fix for pointers in an extent overflowing the max (16) on a
       filesystem with many devices: we were creating too many cached
       copies when moving data around. Now, we only create at most one
       cached copy if there's a promote target set.
  
       Caching will be a bit broken for reflinked data until 6.13: I have
       larger series queued up which significantly improves the plumbing
       for data options down into the extent (bch_extent_rebalance) to fix
       this.
  
     - Fix for deadlock on -ENOSPC on tiny filesystems
  
       Allocation from the partial open_bucket list wasn't correctly
       accounting partial open_buckets as free: this fixes the main cause
       of tests timing out in the automated tests"

   "Some trivial syzbot fixes, two more serious btree fixes found by
    looping single_devices.ktest small_nodes:
  
     - Topology error on split after merge, where we accidentaly picked
       the node being deleted for the pivot, resulting in an assertion pop
  
     - New nodes being preallocated were left on the freedlist, unlocked,
       resulting in them sometimes being accidentally freed: this dated
       from pre-cycle detector, when we could leave them locked. This
       should have resulted in more explosions and fireworks, but turned
       out to be surprisingly hard to hit because the preallocated nodes
       were being used right away.

       handling was a bit invasive - but we've now got more assertions and
