This post summarizes bcachefs merges that landed in Linux 6.14.

## RC1

- **2025-01-30**: Merge tag 'bcachefs-2025-01-29' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs ([commit](https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/8080ff5ac656b9ca6c282e4044be19d2b8a837df))

  Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
  
   - second half of a fix for a bug that'd been causing oopses on
     filesystems using snapshots with memory pressure (key cache fills for
     snaphots btrees are tricky)
  
   - build fix for strange compiler configurations that double stack frame
     size
  
   - "journal stuck timeout" now takes into account device latency: this
     fixes some spurious warnings, and the main remaining source of SRCU
     lock hold time warnings (I'm no longer seeing this in my CI, so any
     users still seeing this should definitely ping me)
  
   - fix for slow/hanging unmounts (" Improve journal pin flushing")
  
   - some more tracepoint fixes/improvements, to chase down the "rebalance
     isn't making progress" issues
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2025-01-29' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:
    bcachefs: Improve trace_move_extent_finish
    bcachefs: Fix trace_copygc
    bcachefs: Journal writes are now IOPRIO_CLASS_RT
    bcachefs: Improve journal pin flushing
    bcachefs: fix bch2_btree_node_flags
    bcachefs: rebalance, copygc enabled are runtime opts
    bcachefs: Improve decompression error messages
    bcachefs: bset_blacklisted_journal_seq is now AUTOFIX
    bcachefs: "Journal stuck" timeout now takes into account device latency
    bcachefs: Reduce stack frame size of __bch2_str_hash_check_key()
    bcachefs: Fix btree_trans_peek_key_cache()
  ```

   "Just small stuff.
  
    As a general announcement, on disk format is now frozen in my master
    branch - future on disk format changes will be optional, not required.
  
     - More fixes for going read-only: the previous fix was insufficient,
       but with more work on ordering journal reclaim flushing (and a
       btree node accounting fix so we don't split until we have to) the
       tiering_replication test now consistently goes read-only in less
       than a second.
  
     - fix for fsck when we have reflink pointers to missing indirect
       extents
  
     - some transaction restart handling fixes from Alan; the "Pass
       _orig_restart_count to trans_was_restarted" likely fixes some rare
       undefined behaviour heisenbugs"
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2025-02-12' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:
    bcachefs: Reuse transaction
    bcachefs: Pass _orig_restart_count to trans_was_restarted
    bcachefs: CONFIG_BCACHEFS_INJECT_TRANSACTION_RESTARTS
    bcachefs: Fix want_new_bset() so we write until the end of the btree node
    bcachefs: Split out journal pins by btree level
    bcachefs: Fix use after free
    bcachefs: Fix marking reflink pointers to missing indirect extents
  ```

   "Small stuff:
  
     - The fsck code for Hongbo's directory i_size patch was wrong, caught
       by transaction restart injection: we now have the CI running
       another test variant with restart injection enabled
  
     - Another fixup for reflink pointers to missing indirect extents:
       previous fix was for fsck code, this fixes the normal runtime paths
  
     - Another small srcu lock hold time fix, reported by jpsollie"
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2025-02-20' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:
    bcachefs: Fix srcu lock warning in btree_update_nodes_written()
    bcachefs: Fix bch2_indirect_extent_missing_error()
    bcachefs: Fix fsck directory i_size checking

   "A couple small ones, the main user visible changes/fixes are:
  
     - Fix a bug where truncate would rarely fail and return 1
  
     - Revert the directory i_size code: this turned out to have a number
       of issues that weren't noticed because the fsck code wasn't
       correctly reporting errors (ouch), and we're late enough in the
       cycle that it can just wait until 6.15"
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2025-02-26' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:

  Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
  
   - Fix a compatibility issue: we shouldn't be setting incompat feature
     bits unless explicitly requested
  
   - Fix another bug where the journal alloc/resize path could spuriously
     fail with -BCH_ERR_open_buckets_empty
  
   - Copygc shouldn't run on read-only devices: fragmentation isn't an
     issue if we're not currently writing to a given device, and it may
     not have anywhere to move the data to
  
  * tag 'bcachefs-2025-03-06' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs:
    bcachefs: copygc now skips non-rw devices
    bcachefs: Fix bch2_dev_journal_alloc() spuriously failing
    bcachefs: Don't set BCH_FEATURE_incompat_version_field unless requested
